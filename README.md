To run project edit .env file in api directory and provide MongoDB URL with database name. Create collection `users` in mentioned database and fill it with at least one user's information: email (String) and password (String, bcrypt hash).

The next step is installation dependecies - run `npm install` in both api and front directories. After that process execute `npm start` in api and then `npm start` in front.
